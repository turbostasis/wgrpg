				<div class='blogPost blogPostContents'><div class="blogHeader">The Game</div><br/><br/>Turris Puesco is a browser-based RPG that caters to those with a fetish for feederism, bbw/bhm and weight gain. In addition to classic text-based dungeon crawler mechanics, there will be an emphasis on interactions with the game world that change according to your character's weight. Features planned include a mercenary system, allowing you to micromanage a team of NPCs to conquer dungeons for you, a relationship system that allows you to subtly (or not-so-subtly) influence NPCs to gain weight for you, a server-wide market system allowing you to buy and sell items from other players with in-game currency, and possibly more multiplayer options in the future depending on how desirable they are to the player base.</div>
				
				<div class='blogPost blogPostContents'><div class="blogHeader">The Backstory</div><br/><br/>Turici is a small port city with little to its name. It's not a trade hub, font of natural resources, nor has it birthed any famous poets or other notables. However, it does have one thing, and that's the Tower. Created by a mad witch millennia ago, it is fabled to hold vast treasures for any brave enough to plumb its heights, and any who reach the top are said to have their wildest dreams come true.
<br/><br/>
Turici began as a simple adventurer's camp for those brave enough to strike at the tower. It flourished as more and more brave hopefuls arrived on the scene looking to claim riches of their own. Before long, a thriving city was born around the tower, and was even named 'Tall Tower' or Turici in the old tongue.
<br/><br/>
Those days are long past however, as some great tragedy struck 200 years ago, shutting the tower tight and causing all the wealth that had poured from it to dry up. Needless to say today Turici is but a shadow of its former glory. In a last ditch effort to save the town's economy, the desperate town leaders reopened the tower dubbed "Turris Puesco" to any and all mercenaries to explore. This is where you come in, an up and coming local looking to get your piece of the riches.
<br/><br/>
However, it would appear as though the dangers that shut the tower years ago have not been distinguished. Rumors have begun to surface that the mad witch of the tower has awoken and wishes to use the local population for her own devices. Knowing this, will you put your life on the line and brave the tower?</div>

				<text>Your armour has become way too tight, to the point where you can hardly breath. For your own safety, you decide it best to take off the armour. However, the act of pulling off the cuirass proves to be quite the struggle, leaving you panting. Your belly heaves in and out as you try to catch your breath.</text>

				<text>You pull the mail over your head and stick your arms through the holes. It rests on your chest a bit loosely, but it should fit. Next you pull the chestpiece over your head. There's quite a lot of room, and moving around causes the chestpiece to slap against your breasts.</text>

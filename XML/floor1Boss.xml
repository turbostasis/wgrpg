		<eventText>A snarling, hulking creature approaches you, its beady eyes glaring into your own with a hatred that seems almost bestial in origin. Its muscles are locked in a rigid battle pose, one hand gripping a thick stock of wood with a metal chunk affixed at the end. This is what may pass for a hammer for him, you imagine. This creature seems different from the others that you've encountered thus far. It seems prestiged; decorated. Donned in chainmail and heavy combat boots, you can tell that this creature is accustomed to battle, and it even exudes leadership qualities as if it were the chief of its people. You have little time to take all of this in however, as without warning the creature lurches forward with a wet, guttural warcry!</eventText>

		<eventText>The goblin chief lets out one last guttural cry as it collapses to the ground with a thud, defeated. You approach gingerly, beginning to feel the injuries you sustained from the encounter as adrenaline fades. The goblin is no longer breathing heavy as it was earlier, and it makes no movements. You step around the lifeless mound of flesh and approach the staircase the creature had been guarding. Should you press on?</eventText>
